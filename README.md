This is a single player game. A player controls the motion of a ship (on screen) with the use of a 
keyboard. The ship begins at the centre of the screen and begins to move forward once the game 
has started. The ship will then proceed to navigate the environment, if it attacks or passes a
competing ship, it is one step closer to its destination if a competing ship passes it there’s a chance it 
may never reach its destination.
